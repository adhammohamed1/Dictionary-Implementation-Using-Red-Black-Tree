# Dictionary-Implementation-Using-Red-Black-Tree
 
A red-black tree is a self-balancing BST. It has the advantage of ensuring a worst case of O(log n) time complexity at all times whereas a BST may become degenerate (skewed) and require O(n).

This implementation contains all of the basic BST operations except remove.
 
This program lets you: 
1. Load dictionary from text file into a red-black tree
2. Print the number of words present in the dictionary
3. Insert a word
4. Check if a word exists in the dictionary or not
5. Print the height of the tree
